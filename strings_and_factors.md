Strings and Factors
================

## String vectors

``` r
string_vec = c("my", "name", "is", "jeff")
```

``` r
string_vec = c(
  "i think we all rule for participating",
  "i think i have been caught",
  "i think this will be quite fun actually",
  "it will be fun, i think"
  )
```

``` r
string_vec = c(
  "Y'all remember Pres. HW Bush?",
  "I saw a green bush",
  "BBQ and Bushwalking at Molonglo Gorge",
  "BUSH -- LIVE IN CONCERT!!"
  )
```

``` r
string_vec = c(
  '7th inning stretch',
  '1st half soon to begin. Texas won the toss.',
  'she is 5 feet 4 inches tall',
  '3AM - cant sleep :('
  )
```

``` r
string_vec = c(
  'Its 7:11 in the evening',
  'want to go to 7-11?',
  'my flight is AA711',
  'NetBios: scanning ip 203.167.114.66'
  )
```

``` r
string_vec = c(
  'The CI is [2, 5]',
  ':-]',
  ':-[',
  'I found the answer on pages [6-7]'
  )
```

## Why factors are weird

``` r
factor_vec = factor(c("male", "male", "female", "female"))
```

## NSDUH

``` r
nsduh_url = "http://samhda.s3-us-gov-west-1.amazonaws.com/s3fs-public/field-uploads/2k15StateFiles/NSDUHsaeShortTermCHG2015.htm"

table_marj = 
  read_html(nsduh_url) %>% 
  html_table() %>% 
  first() %>% 
  slice(-1)
```
